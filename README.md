# Skip-gram model
Vanilla Skip-gram model for word embedding.

All codes are tested under Python 3.5 and Tensorflow 1.1

# Get started
To run the program, do the following steps:
1. Change the directory to the folder
2. Run the command `python train.py`


# Acknowledgement
The file `processed_data.py` is adapted from the example [codes](https://github.com/chiphuyen/tf-stanford-tutorials/blob/master/examples/process_data.py) of [Stanford CS 20SI 2017](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/). Original codes were compatible for Python 2.7 and Tensorflow 0.8. We have been modified them and tested under Python 3.5 and Tensorflow 1.1 .
